# Control which channels we like to spend more time on.  By default, the list
# of channels is pulled from the driver automatically.  By setting preferred channels,
# if they are present in the channel list, they'll be set with a timing delay so that
# more time is spent on them.  Since 1, 6, 11 are the common default channels, it makes
# sense to spend more time monitoring them.
# For finer control, see further down in the config for the channellist= directives.

# Default channel lists
# These channel lists MUST BE PRESENT for Kismet to work properly.  While it is
# possible to change these, it is not recommended.  These are used when the supported
# channel list can not be found for the source; to force using these instead of
# the detected supported channels, override with channellist= in the source defintion
#
# IN GENERAL, if you think you want to modify these, what you REALLY want to do is
# copy them and use channellist= in the packet source.

# Packet filtering options:
# filter_tracker - Packets filtered from the tracker are not processed or
#                  recorded in any way.
# filter_export  - Controls what packets influence the exported CSV, network,
#                  xml, gps, etc files.
# All filtering options take arguments containing the type of address and
# addresses to be filtered.  Valid address types are 'ANY', 'BSSID',
# 'SOURCE', and 'DEST'.  Filtering can be inverted by the use of '!' before
# the address.  For example,
# filter_tracker=ANY(!"00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF")
# has the same effect as the previous mac_filter config file option.

# Alerts to be reported and the throttling rates.
# alert=name,throttle/unit,burst
# The throttle/unit describes the number of alerts of this type that are

# Burst describes the number of alerts sent before throttling takes place.
# For example:
# alert=FOO,10/min,5
# Would allow 5 alerts through before throttling is enabled, and will then
# limit the number of alerts to 10 per minute.
# A throttle rate of 0 disables throttling of the alert.
